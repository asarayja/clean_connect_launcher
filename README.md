# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Suggestions for troubleshooting:

Ensure FiveM is properly installed.

Use launcher settings to clear cache, crashes, and other FiveM files.

If the problem persists, restart your PC and try again.

Reinstall FiveM with user backup (if you were logged in with a Cfx account, no re-authentication is required as the launcher ensures your data is restored correctly after reinstallation).

Install / Reinstall FiveM:
